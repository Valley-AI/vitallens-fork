# Web Components

`vitallens.js` includes a suite of pre-built Custom Elements. These allow you to drop fully functional vitals scanning UIs into your application with a single HTML tag.

## Setup

Ensure you have imported the browser bundle:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vitallens/dist/vitallens.browser.js"></script>
```

All components share the same core attributes for authentication:

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `api-key` | Your VitalLens API Key. |
| `proxy-url` | URL to your backend proxy (Alternative to `api-key` for production security). |
